There are pre-preprared filepaths to the MoBa phenotypic data and linkage file (for merging with genetic data) in the script 01_data_prep.R

The file 00_example_merge_script_MoBa_pheo_geno.R is an example script for how to merge genetic and phenotypic data.

The naming convention used here is 00_>what_script_does<.R for peripheral scripts; 01_>what_first_analytic_script_does<.R... 0n_>what_nth_analytic_script_does<.R for core analytic scripts.
